# Lunchroom Inventory

## Description
In many schools, the lunchroom is typically the most neglected area when updating technology for checking inventory. This process typically involves printing out 50+ pages worth of inventory items. Many of those items do not apply to the individual school at each level (Elementary, Middle, and High). Each has different requirements and types of food items to serve to the students. The issue is that the entirety of the items in inventory is compiled into one single inventory list. While the pages are printed, the Cafe Manager, using a legal pad, starts the count by writing down the description of each item in the freezer, cooler, and stock room while physically counting each item by hand. Once the count has been completed, the entire list must be transferred to the printed list, which can be very time-consuming looking for each item and then transferring the counts to the page. Once all that is complete, the manager has to input all of that information into the computer program that requires every field to be filled in with the count, or, if the item is not used at the school, it must contain a zero. This process can take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours to complete, wasting time, and money.

## How to Use the Application
Once the user is logged in, they will be presented with a screen that gives them options to scan an item via a barcode, or to search by an item number.  Once one of those inputs are submitted, the item will display on the screen with the item id, name, description, and the three main quantity options.  Once the quantity has been input, and submitted, it will be saved into the inventory list.       
          
They will also be given an option to add an item to the inventory when a brand new item is introduced.  The user can also add a barcode number to an item at anytime, as well as add more barcode's to an existing item in the case of a substituted brand for an established item.  

## Future Functionality
While this is a prototype application for an existing issue, unfortunately we do not have access to the current database.  In the future, we would like to be able to incorporate the existing database so that once the item is added in the application, it will easily populate all the pertinent data on the existing database to speed up the inventory process even more.  The future goal is to have inventory of all lunchrooms take less than 2 hours in total.
