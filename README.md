# Lunchroom Inventory

## Description
    In many schools all across the country, the lunchroom is typically the most neglected area when it comes to updating technology for checking inventory.  This process typically involves printing out 40+ pages worth of inventory items, many of those items do not apply to the individual school as each level (Elementary, Middle, and High) have different requirements and types of food items to be served to the students.  The issue with this fact is that the list of all items in the district are all compiled into one single inventory list.  While the pages are being printed, the Cafe Manager is grabbing a legal pad, and starting the count by writing down the description of each item in the freezer, cooler, and stock room, as well as physically counting each item by hand. Once everything is counted, then the entire list must be transferred to the printed list, which can be very time consuming looking for each individual item, and then transferring the counts to the page.  Then, once all that is done, the manager then has to transfer all of that information into the computer program that requires every field to be filled in with the count, or, if the item is not used at the school, it must contain a zero.  This process can take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours to complete, wasting time, and money.

## How to Use the Application
    Once the user is logged in, they will be presented with a screen that gives them options to scan an item via a barcode, or to search by an item number.  Once one of those inputs are submitted, the item will display on the screen with the item id, name, description, and the three main quantity options.  Once the quantity has been input, and submitted, it will be saved into the inventory list.       
          
    They will also be given an option to add an item to the inventory when a brand new item is introduced.  The user can also add a barcode number to an item at anytime, as well as add more barcode's to an existing item in the case of a substituted brand for an established item.  

## Future Functionality
    While this is a prototype application for an existing issue, unfortunately we do not have access to the current database.  In the future, we would like to be able to incorporate the existing database so that once the item is added in the application, it will easily populate all the pertinent data on the existing database to speed up the inventory process even more.  The future goal is to have inventory of all lunchrooms take less than 2 hours in total.
